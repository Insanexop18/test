                    <h2>Project Engagements</h2>

                    <h3>Proposals & Agreements</h3>
                    <p>All project engagements begin with a written proposal outlining scope, deliverables, timeline, and pricing. A project is considered confirmed only when the Client returns a signed proposal or provides written confirmation (email is acceptable) and pays any required deposit.</p>

                    <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
                    <p>Timelines stated in proposals are estimates based on the agreed scope. Delays caused by late feedback, scope changes, or failure to provide required materials from the Client will extend the timeline accordingly. SparkForge will communicate any changes to the timeline promptly.</p>

                    <h3>Delivery</h3>
                    <p>Completed work will be delivered to the Client via the method agreed in the proposal (e.g., deployment to a hosting environment, file transfer, or staging link). Final delivery is conditional on receipt of all outstanding payments.</p>

                    <h3>Post-Launch Support</h3>
                    <p>All projects include 30 days of complimentary post-launch support covering bug fixes directly related to our delivered work. This does not cover new features, third-party issues, or problems arising from Client-made changes. Extended support is available under a separate maintenance agreement.</p>

                    <h2>Payment Terms</h2>

                    <h3>Pricing</h3>
                    <p>All prices are stated in Indian Rupees (INR) unless otherwise specified in writing. For international clients, an equivalent amount in USD, GBP, or other agreed currency may be invoiced at the prevailing exchange rate on the invoice date.</p>

                    <h3>Payment Schedule</h3>
                    <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, our standard payment structure is:</p>

                                <strong>Final payment</strong>
                                <span>Due before final delivery or launch. No project goes live with outstanding balances.</span>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Late Payments</h3>
                    <p>Invoices are due within <strong>7 days</strong> of issue unless otherwise agreed. Payments overdue by more than 14 days may result in work being paused. We reserve the right to charge interest at 2% per month on outstanding balances after 30 days.</p>

                    <h3>Refunds</h3>
                    <p>The initial deposit is non-refundable once work has commenced. If a project is cancelled by the Client after the deposit stage, any work completed up to the cancellation point will be billed at our standard rates. If SparkForge cancels a project without cause, a full refund of the deposit will be issued.</p>

                    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

                    <h3>Client-Owned Assets</h3>
                    <p>Upon receipt of full payment, the Client is granted full ownership of all custom code, designs, and deliverables created specifically for their project. This transfer of ownership applies only to original work created by SparkForge for that specific engagement.</p>

                    <h3>SparkForge-Owned Assets</h3>
                    <p>SparkForge retains ownership of:</p>
                    <ul class="policy-list">
                        <li>Internal frameworks, libraries, and boilerplate code developed prior to or independently of the Client's project.</li>
                        <li>General tools, utilities, and methodologies used in delivering services.</li>
                        <li>Any pre-existing intellectual property incorporated into the final deliverable, for which the Client receives a perpetual, royalty-free licence to use.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Third-Party Licences</h3>
                    <p>Projects may incorporate third-party software, fonts, stock imagery, or other licensed assets. The Client is responsible for ensuring continued compliance with the licence terms of any such assets after project handover. SparkForge will clearly document any third-party assets used.</p>

                    <h3>Portfolio Rights</h3>
                    <p>Unless the Client explicitly requests otherwise in writing, SparkForge reserves the right to feature completed work in our portfolio, case studies, and marketing materials.</p>

                    <h2>Client Obligations</h2>
                    <p>The Client agrees to:</p>

                        <li><strong>Provide materials on time</strong> — including content, images, copy, brand assets, and login credentials required to complete the project within the agreed timeline.</li>
                        <li><strong>Give timely feedback</strong> — respond to review requests within <strong>5 business days</strong>. Extended delays may result in rescheduled timelines or additional charges.</li>
                        <li><strong>Designate a point of contact</strong> — a single person authorised to make decisions and approve work on behalf of the Client organisation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Provide accurate information</strong> — ensure that any content, data, or materials supplied to SparkForge do not infringe any third-party rights and comply with applicable laws.</li>
                        <li><strong>Respect intellectual property</strong> — not copy, reverse-engineer, or resell SparkForge's internal tools, frameworks, or methodologies.</li>

                    <h3>Included Revisions</h3>
                    <p>Each project proposal specifies the number of revision rounds included. Standard projects include <strong>two rounds of revisions</strong> per major deliverable unless otherwise stated.</p>

                    <h3>Out-of-Scope Work</h3>
                    <p>Any work requested beyond the agreed scope — including new features, design changes after approval, or additional pages — will be treated as a new work order and quoted separately. SparkForge will always notify the Client before commencing out-of-scope work and obtain written approval.</p>

                    <h3>Scope Creep</h3>
                    <p>Significant changes to project scope after work has commenced may require a revised proposal and timeline. SparkForge reserves the right to adjust pricing if scope changes materially alter the complexity or time required.</p>

                    <p>Confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that: (a) is or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; (b) was already known to the receiving party before disclosure; or (c) is required to be disclosed by law or a competent authority.</p>
                    <p>These obligations survive the completion or termination of any project engagement for a period of <strong>3 years</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>Termination</h2>

                    <h3>Termination by Client</h3>
                    <p>The Client may terminate a project engagement at any time by providing written notice. In such cases, the Client shall pay for all work completed to the date of termination at the agreed project rate. The initial deposit is non-refundable.</p>

                    <h3>Termination by SparkForge</h3>
                    <p>SparkForge reserves the right to terminate a project or suspend services if:</p>
                    <ul class="policy-list">
                        <li>The Client fails to make payment within 30 days of an overdue invoice.</li>
                        <li>The Client requests work that is illegal, unethical, or in violation of these Terms.</li>
                        <li>The Client engages in abusive, threatening, or unreasonable behaviour toward our team.</li>
                        <li>Circumstances beyond our reasonable control make it impossible to continue the engagement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In such cases, SparkForge will provide reasonable notice and invoice for all work completed to that point. No refund of deposit will be issued if termination is due to Client breach.</p>

                    <h3>Effect of Termination</h3>
                    <p>Upon termination: (a) all outstanding payments become immediately due; (b) each party shall return or destroy the other's confidential information; (c) rights to incomplete deliverables remain with SparkForge until full payment is received for work done.</p>
